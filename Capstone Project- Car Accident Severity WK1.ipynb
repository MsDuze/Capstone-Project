Given the available data, it has been agreed that the best approach would be to be able to predict the severity of accidents that may occur due to certain conditions. It is believed that this new information will help with better planning and decision making for all stakeholders thereby reducing the risks and by extension,  reducing the possibility of the occurrence of future accidents.\n\nOver time, the Traffic Department has established a correlation between several factors such as weather, traffic, etc and the severity of road traffic accidents. The extent of this correlation remains sketchy and this model intends to determine the extent of the these dependencies and predict how they affect the severity of car accidents.\n\nThe expected audience of this report includes but is not restricted to the following:\n1. The Seattle Traffic Department\n2. Seattle Police Department\n3. Seattle Emergency Services\n4. The Medical Board/Hospitals\n5. All road users in Seattle\n6. Travellers that may drive to/through Seattle enroute other destinations."
